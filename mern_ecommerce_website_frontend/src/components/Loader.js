/*According to the Bootstrap documentation, the sr-only class is used to hide information 
that is intended only for screen readers from the layout of a rendered page.

If you do not include a label for every input, screen readers may have trouble with the 
forms. For such inline forms, you can hide labels with the sr-only class.

You must always consider screen readers for accessibility purposes. Usage of this class
will hide the element, and thus, you wonâ€™t see a visual difference. */
