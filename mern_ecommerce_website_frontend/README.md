# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The UI framework is from https://www.bootswatch.com

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Instead of Bootstrap we use react-bootstrap and Bootswatch as an alternative to CSS-Bootstrap.

In react-Bootstrap(npm i react-bootstrap) the functionalities are same except that the components are react components rather than Bootstrap-CSS components.

## Installed axios file(npm i axios) in frontend which does the following things:

    =>It is a http library which is used to make http requests to our backend('fetch api' could also be used)

## in .env file we can keep confidential information(like API keys,passwords, etc...)
